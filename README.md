## Description
A small personal project completed in 4 days. I'm an absent-minded person, so I often forget birthdays, which is why I created this project. The advantage over Google Calendar is that it's easy to add people and share lists of people.
This project was mainly created to improve my Python skills.

## Download
You can [download](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/electron-markdownify/releases/tag/v1.2.0) the latest installable version of Markdownify for Windows, macOS and Linux.

## Key Features
* You can easily share birthday lists.
* Activate the program at Windows startup.
* You can interact with the menu to:
    - Add a person to the list
    - Remove a person from the list
    - Enable or disable the option to launch at Windows startup.
